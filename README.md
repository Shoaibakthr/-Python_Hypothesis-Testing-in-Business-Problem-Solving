# Python_Hypothesis-Testing-in-Business-Problem-Solving

Overview:
Hypothesis testing is a powerful statistical tool used to address various business challenges by analyzing data and drawing conclusions. This repository showcases how hypothesis testing was applied to solve multiple business problems.

Methodology:
Formulate Hypotheses: Clearly define null and alternative hypotheses based on the business problem.
Data Collection: Gather relevant data sets for analysis.
Hypothesis Testing: Choose appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-test, chi-square test) based on the data type and hypothesis.
Analysis: Conduct hypothesis tests and interpret results to draw meaningful conclusions.
Decision Making: Use the results to make informed decisions and implement necessary actions.

Usage:
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to access the datasets and code used for hypothesis testing.
Explore Business Problems: Review the different business problems addressed and the corresponding hypotheses.
Run Hypothesis Tests: Execute the provided code to conduct hypothesis tests on the datasets.
Interpret Results: Analyze the results to understand the implications for each business problem.
